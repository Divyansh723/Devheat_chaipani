                        <p>The 1.1 million strong Indian Army lost one braveheart every 3 days in the last 13 years. After
                            years of hardwork and moments of great courage, they face their end, leaving behind their
                            families after serving the nation selflessly. </p>
                        <p>Left without their breadwinners, families after families have to wait around for government funds
                            and handouts which may take a long time to be distributed. This is why we created
                            <strong>Tribute.</strong> </p>
                        <p><strong>Tribute</strong> is an online funding website created with the aim of providing financial
                            support to the families left behind by martyred soldiers. So many common people want to help
                            such families of martyred soldiers, but don't know how. We make sure that those who want to
                            help, can do so securely and quite easily, so we created this </p>
                        <p>The funds go directly to the bank accounts of an authenticated family member, and we make sure to
                            provide a certificate to each donater!</p>

                                and if you can, consider making a small donation for this very noble cause.</p>
