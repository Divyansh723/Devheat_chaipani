                    <p style="text-align: center">
                    <p class="card-text">During 2022, Capt Anand Kumar’s unit 15 Raj Rif was deployed in Mendhar sector
                        of Poonch district in Jammu and Kashmir. The unit was manning the forward posts along the LOC in
                        Poonch district. As the area of his unit’s operation was very volatile and prone to infiltration
                        by militants, the unit had to maintain a strict vigil at all times and deployed armed patrols
                        with regular frequency. The landmines along the patrol routes posed a serious danger to the
                        troops and the Bomb Disposal Squad of the unit was often called upon to sanitize the routes. On
                        17 July 2022, Capt Anand Kumar was tasked to lead one area domination patrol in the unit's AOR.

                        As Capt Anand Kumar and his comrades were traversing through the challenging terrain as per the
                        planned patrol route, there was a massive mine blast. The blast had a devastating effect,
                        injuring Capt Anand Kumar, Nb Sub Bhagwan Singh and many of their comrades. The injured soldiers
                        were immediately air lifted to Military Hospital Udhampur for medical treatment. However Capt
                        Anand Kumar and his Junior Commissioned Officer, Nb Sub Bhagwan Singh later succumbed to their
                        injuries and were martyred. Capt Anand Kumar was slated to get married soon but he was more
                        devoted to the higher cause of serving the motherland and laid down his life in the service of
                        the nation at the age of 26 years.
